-- MERN stack project --

This has been a fun project to work on. It turned out to be a lot bigger than I expected, because of that there area few things that I need to continue polishing up.

the filter works for individual sections, but when looking for something from a specific country and a specific rating it wont work as expected.

the sorting works for all columns except for the notifications column.

the styles are close but arent exactly matched and need some work.

the search as of right now is not functional.

I intend to keep working on this until it is fully functional.

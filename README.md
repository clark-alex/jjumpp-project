-- MERN stack project --

This has been a fun project to work on. It turned out to be a lot bigger than I expected, because of that there area few things that I need to continue polishing up.

the filter works for individual sections, but when looking for something from a specific country and a specific rating it wont work as expected.

the styles are close but arent exactly matched and need some work.

the search is functional, but only on a case insensitive match, I need to go make it work on partial matches as well.

the naming conventions especially for css got hard to follow as the project got bigger. that is a skill that I need to improve on.

I intend to keep working on this until it is fully functional.
